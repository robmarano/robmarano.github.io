   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>Course Learning Outcomes</h3>
<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
      <ol  class="enumerate1" >
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5002x1">Set up a working and extensible C development environment using the Linux operating
      system.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5004x2">Be  able  to  demonstrate  working  understanding  of  the  main  C  mechanisms  for
      in-memory structures, computation, network communication, and external storage.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5006x3">Understand and demonstrate basic programming mechanisms of Python 3, including
      graphing numerical data.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5008x4">Collaborative programming using GitHub for source code and project documentation,
      in addition to Kanban agile management.</li></ol>
<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>Communication Policy</h3>
<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >The best way to contact me is via email then by instant messaging (TBD by end of first class). I
will do my best to respond within 24 hours. Communication and participation in class is not only
encouraged, but required.
<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a>Course Expectations</h3>
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>Class Preparation</h4>
<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >Each session will consist of two components: discussion and lab. Discussion consists of a mix of
lectures, programming examples, and question-driven group analysis of one or more large
programming problems. Lab will consist of either group or individual work on exercises or
projects. Questions arising during lab may be used to fuel additional discussion as time
permits.

<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>Attendance</h4>
<!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" >Success as a student begins with attendance. Class time is not only for learning new skills, but also
for practicing what you have learned. Some assignments and demos may be completed in class, but
practice and study are required outside of class. Students are expected to attend classes regularly,
arrive on time, and participate.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   I take attendance during every session, and it forms part of your grade. Students are
encouraged to e-mail me when they are absent. Students are responsible for all academic work
missed as a result of absences. It is at my discretion to work with students outside of class time in
order to make-up any missed work.
