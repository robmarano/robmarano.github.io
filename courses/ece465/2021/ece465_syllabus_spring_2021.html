   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Course Description</h3>
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >You will dive deep, hands-on, to study critical, foundational technology components that enable
cloud computing, and the engineering advancements that have led to today&#8217;s thriving cloud
computing ecosystem. Students understand, design, build and test representational software units
that implement different distributed computing components, e.g., parallel logic, software-defined
networking, computers, storage, databases, and security. Topics include multi-threaded
programming; functional programming (map-reduce). Hadoop: a programmer&#8217;s perspective;
streams processing to collect data; AI/ML inference model training, validation, and execution; &amp;
modern development and DevOps of serverless applications. This course prepares the student with
foundational knowledge and experience to prepare for a variety of cloud computing professional
certifications. <br

   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>Class Preparation</h4>
<!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >Each session will consist of two components: discussion and lab. Discussion consists of a mix of
lectures, programming examples, and question-driven group analysis of one or more large
programming problems. Lab will consist of either group or individual work on exercises or
projects. Questions arising during lab may be used to fuel additional discussion as time
permits.
<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>Attendance</h4>
<!--l. 98--><p class="noindent" >Success as a student begins with attendance. Class time is not only for learning new skills, but also
for practicing what you have learned. Some assignments and demos may be completed in class, but
practice and study are required outside of class. Students are expected to attend classes regularly,
arrive on time, and participate. <br 
class="newline" />I take attendance during every session, and it forms part of your grade. Students are encouraged to
e-mail me when they are absent. Students are responsible for all academic work missed as a result
of absences. It is at my discretion to work with students outside of class time in order to make-up
any missed work.

millions of users and only pay for what you use. Mind blown! In years past, companies paid
UP-FRONT for equipment that would stand idle but needed for surge and growth capacities. That
equipment was already old in functionality 18-24 months after purchase, but they would amortize
it over 5 to 10 years. Not good for continual, rapid innovation... Let&#8217;s see what we need to build

class="cmbx-12">Description: </span>One of the best examples of using distributed computing (in the cloud) includes
machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), that is, teaching a computing system to
think similar to a human to make decisions to take actions based on problems that don&#8217;t
necessarily have a closed form solution and may have increasing numbers of inputs to consider.
We&#8217;ll cover Amazon&#8217;s Jupyter notebook service, i.e., SageMaker, to learn how to build and execute
models in the cloud and at the (IoT) edge.  <br
