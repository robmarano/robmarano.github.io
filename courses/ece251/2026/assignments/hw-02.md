## Problem Set

§ means "section," and §§ means "sections"

### 1. <From Textbook §2.2>

For the C statement,
`f = g + (h – 5);`
what is the corresponding MIPS assembly code? Assume that the C variables `f`, `g`, and `h`, have already been placed in registers `$s0`, `$s1`, and `$s2`, respectively. Use a minimal number of MIPS assembly instructions.

### 2. <From Textbook §§2.2, 2.3>
Translate the following MIPS code to C. Assume that the variables `f`, `g`, `h`, `i`, and `j` are assigned to registers `$s0`, `$s1`, `$s2`, `$s3`, and `$s4`, respectively. Assume that the base address of the arrays `A` and `B` are in registers `$s6` and `$s7`, respectively.

```mips
addi $t0, $s6, 4
add $t1, $s6, $0
sw $t1, 0($t0)
lw $t0, 0($t0)
add $s0, $t1, $t0
````

### 3. <From Textbook §§2.3, 2.5>

For each MIPS instruction in Problem #2 above, show the value of the opcode (op), source register (rs) and funct field, and destination register (rd) fields. For the I-type instructions, show the value of the immediate field, and for the R-type instructions, show the value of the second source register (rt). Show as a table with the following columns: instruction, type, opcode, rs, rt, rd, immed.
