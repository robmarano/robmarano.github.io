# Homework Assignment 
## Problem Set
§ means "section," and §§ means "sections"
### (1) <From Textbook §2.2> For the C statement,
`f = g + (h – 5);` <br> <br>
what is the corresponding MIPS assembly code? Assume that the C variables `f`, `g`, and `h`, have already been placed in registers `$s0`, `$s1`, and `$s2`, respectively. Use a minimal number of MIPS assembly instructions.
### (2) <From Textbook §§2.2, 2.3> Translate the following MIPS code to C. Assume that the variables `f`, `g`, `h`, `i`, and `j` are assigned to registers `$s0`, `$s1`, `$s2`, `$s3`, and `$s4`, respectively. Assume that the base address of the arrays `A` and `B` are in registers `$s6` and `$s7`, respectively.
```assembly
addi $t0, $s6, 4
add $t1, $s6, $0
sw $t1, 0($t0)
lw $t0, 0($t0)
add $s0, $t1, $t0
```
### (3) <From Textbook §§2.3, 2.5> For each MIPS instruction in Problem #2 above, show the value of the opcode (`op`), source register (`rs`) and `funct` field, and destination register (`rd`) fields. For the I-type instructions, show the value of the immediate field, and for the R-type instructions, show the value of the second source register (`rt`). Show as a table with the following columns: `instruction`, `type`, `opcode`, `rs`, `rt`, `rd`, `immed`.
### (4) <From Textbook §2.5> Provide the type, assembly language instruction, and binary representation of instruction described by the following MIPS fields:
```assembly
op=0x23, rs=1, rt=2, const=0x4
```
### (5) Suppose the program counter (PC) is set to `0x20000000`.
(5a) <From Textbook §2.10>What range of addresses can be reached using the MIPS jump-and-link (`jal`) instruction? (In other words, what is the set of possible values for the `PC` after the jump instruction executes?) <br> <br>
(5b) <From Textbook §2.10> What range of addresses can be reached using the MIPS branch if equal (`beq`) instruction? (In other words, what is the set of possible values for the `PC` after the branch instruction executes?)
### (6) Design and implement in SystemVerilog using behavioral modeling an ALU with default bit width size of 8. Support addition, subtraction, multiply, divide, `and`, `or`, `not`, `sll`, `slr` at the very least for signed and unsigned integer operands.
### (7) Design and implement in SystemVerilog a simplified memory layout from and to which you can load and store data, using byte addressing.
