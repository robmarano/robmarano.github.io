Do your work on your specific GitHub Classroom repo. Remember to just add the GitHub repository to the Microsoft Team's assignment from here. Using Behavioral Modeling in SystemVerilog, create the following modules that will be used in your final project â€” your CPU and memory design of your own computer. Parameterize your bit length so that you can define any bit size in your test bench, not hardcoding that in your module definition. Use 8-bits are the default bit length.

1. n-bit full adder
2. (arithmetic) sign extender
3. clock
4. program counter, with inputs clock, reset, enable, increment
5. DFF, with inputs clock, reset, enable
6. n-bit register built from DFF, with inputs clock, reset, enable
