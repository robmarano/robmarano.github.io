# Homework Assignment 

**GitHub Classroom Assignment Link:** https://classroom.github.com/a/XC_j3CKm

You will do all your work, store it in the GitHub Classroom repo that you get when following the assignment link. 

From now on, you will write your homework answers using Markdown in the `README.md` file in your individual GitHub repository you get from the GitHub Classroom assignment. See [homework 1 solution file`](./hw-01-solution.md) as an example format. You will then submit your assignment using GitHub Classroom repo by adding your repo files, committing those files, then pushing your repo to GitHub &mdash; you'll do this with the ```git``` command. Come see me if you still do not understand how to do this.

## Problem Set

Using Behavioral Modeling in SystemVerilog, create the following modules that will be used in your final project &mdash; your CPU and memory design of your own computer. Parameterize your bit length so that you can define any bit size in your test bench, not hardcoding that in your module definition. Use 8-bits are the default bit length.
1. n-bit full adder
1. (arithmetic) sign extender
1. clock
1. program counter, with inputs `clock`, `reset`, `enable`, `increment`
1. DFF, with inputs `clock`, `reset`, `enable`
1. n-bit register built from DFF, with inputs `clock`, `reset`, `enable`
