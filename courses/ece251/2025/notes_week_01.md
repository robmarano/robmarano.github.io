- Basic syntax, data types (e.g., `wire`, `reg`, `logic`), and operators.
- Simple gate primitives (e.g., and, or, not, xor).
- Modeling combinational logic circuits using gate primitives.
- Hands-on lab: Implement basic gates and simple combinational circuits (e.g., half-adder, full-adder).

**SystemVerilog for testbench development:**

- Hands-on lab: Develop a basic testbench for a design

**What is bit swizzling?**

- Bit swizzling is a technique for rearranging the order of bits within a binary data structure, such as a byte, word, or vector.
- It involves extracting specific bits from their original positions and placing them into new positions within another data structure.

Here's a breakdown of bit swizzling:

**Purpose:**

- **Data Reorganization:** Bit swizzling is often used to reorganize data to match specific hardware requirements or to optimize data structures for certain algorithms.
- **Endianness Conversion:** Converting between big-endian and little-endian representations of data involves swizzling bits.
- **Cryptography:** Swizzling bits can be used in cryptographic operations to obscure data patterns.
- **Image Processing:** Manipulating individual bits in image data for tasks like color transformations or image filtering.
- **Error Correction:** Rearranging bits for error detection and correction codes.

**Techniques:**

- **Shifting:** Shifting bits left or right (<<, >>) to move them to new positions.
- **Masking:** Using bitwise AND (&) to isolate specific bits.
- **Concatenation:** Combining bits from different sources using concatenation operators ({ }).
- **Replication:** Repeating specific bits or patterns.

**For Example:**

Let's say you have a 4-bit data structure `1011` and you want to swap the two middle bits.

You could achieve this through swizzling:

1. Isolate the middle bits:
   1. Mask the first and last bits with `0011` to get `0011`.
1. Swap the middle bits:
   1. Shift the isolated bits left by one (`0110`) and right by one (`0011`).
   1. Combine the shifted results using OR (`|`) to get `0111`.
1. Combine with the original outer bits:
   1. Mask the original data with `1001` to get `1001`.
      1. Combine this with the swapped middle bits using OR (`|`) to get the final result `1111`.

**SystemVerilog Support:**

SystemVerilog provides powerful bit swizzling capabilities:

- **Concatenation:** Use the concatenation operator { and } to combine bits in any desired order.
- **Replication:** Specify the number of times to repeat a bit or pattern within the concatenation.
- **Indexed Part-Select:** Extract a specific range of bits using indexed part-select (`[start_bit:end_bit]`).

**Example in SystemVerilog:**

```verilog
logic [7:0] data = 8'b10110100;
logic [7:0] swizzled_data;

swizzled_data = {data[6:7], data[2:3], data[4:5], data[0:1]}; // Swizzle specific bits
```

Bit swizzling is a fundamental technique in computer architecture and digital design, enabling efficient data manipulation and optimization at the bit level.

**More complex gate-level modeling:**

- Using assign statements for continuous assignments.
- Hierarchical design and module instantiation.
- Introduction to testbenches and basic verification concepts.
- Hands-on lab: Build a more complex combinational circuit (e.g., multiplexer, decoder) using hierarchy.

**Introduction to sequential logic:**

- Flip-flops (e.g., DFF, JKFF) and latches.
- Modeling simple sequential circuits (e.g., counters, shift registers).
- Understanding the concept of clocking and timing in simulations.
- Hands-on lab: Implement a simple counter or shift register.

**Advanced gate-level modeling:**

- User-defined primitives (UDPs) for custom gate definitions.
- Delays in gate-level modeling (#delay).
- Introduction to always blocks for procedural assignments.
- Hands-on lab: Design a sequential circuit with custom gate delays and verify its behavior.
